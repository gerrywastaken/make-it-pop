A browser extension that highlights important phrases on web pages using customizable colors.

## What does it do?

Make It Pop lets you define groups of phrases (like "code review", "pull request", etc.) and automatically highlights them when you visit websites. Perfect for:

- Spotting key terms while browsing job postings
- Highlighting important concepts while reading documentation
- Making specific phrases stand out on any website

## Features

- **Domain Control**: Choose which websites use which phrase groups
- **Smart Matching**: Automatically finds phrases regardless of capitalization
- **Dynamic Updates**: Highlights new content as pages load and change
- **Easy Management**: Simple settings page to manage all your groups and domains

## Installation

- **Firefox** (Desktop & Mobile): [Install from Firefox Add-ons](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/make-it-pop/) - fully approved and listed
- **Edge**: Available on Edge Add-ons (pending final approval)
- **Chrome**: Works great, but not listed in Chrome Web Store (they charge open-source developers). You can [download the latest build](https://github.com/gerrywastaken/make-it-pop/releases) and install manually.
